        Hello üñê, I am Somtochukwu. A software developer passionate at writing
        digital solutions to problems (the right way). I'm not a fan of
        abstraction due to my curious mind but I do create one when needed.

        which I utilize for an efficient workflow or upgrade my arsenal of tools
        for the right job.
