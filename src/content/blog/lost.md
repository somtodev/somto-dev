What perspective do I stick with?
"Stop it, you're suffocating me" or "'There's no diamond without pressure"

Over the past two years, I have been in the learning phase of software development. Orbiting the "I think I am getting good" and "You imposter" poles. I am breath deprived from my own thoughts. I really can't breath when I take a step back to think about my trajectory on Earth. In short, I am **Lost**. I do hope not Steve, I till have hope in "the dots connecting in the future".

Not to be overly pessimistic here, I sure did learn a thing or two like "Build, Don't Tell", "Learn it, don't stop ! Build". In the mid of 2022, I had picked up React (almost a year after getting into web development), then I added NodeJS to my stack. (I had the vision of being a MERN stack developer). Then, a duty call from school (semester 2) hit me. I had to learn three entirely different things (my point of view then). Namely, C#, Java and MySQL. Remember I had been preparing to delve into the MERN WORLD. Guess what ?

I halted my MERN journey learning new things I turned out not to use in this current time (for various reason), Java been an exception due to a note app I built a week back. In deciding to air out my mind in writing, the end is yet unknown to me. At 16, in the first quarter of 2023, I lost my mom (I think I am fine). The freedom I had have been limited. Had she been with me, some things would have been easily avoided (so yeah, she has a part in this story).

It's been more of concepts that hands on coding recently because my laptop battery is weak just like my will to live. Pardon me, for I know this writing is all over the place but here's my point. "Knowledge isn't meant to be absorbed rather constantly make her your companion it as you happen to get a hold of her therefore making her a part of you".

I feel lost becuase, I know that I have stuffed myself with too much information and also at the same time created a prison with information I wouldn't be using now. My exploration with Java helped a lot with learning new concepts (I am in love with types). I had learned MSSQL sometime in 2022 to the start of 2023, I failed to apply what I learnt and lost fairly 70% of all I have known like the back of my palms. The year has been so much of a ride. I had learned MSQSQL sometime in 2022 to the start of 2023, I failed to apply what I learnt and lostly fairly 70% of all I have known like the back of my palms. The year has been so much of a ride emotionally, mentally and softwarely?? But, in the process of writing this. I know some dots are connecting and what I want has been made clear to me once again.

I would stick with NodeJS for reasons I think are acceptable (I really wish I started out with PHP). React, Nodejs, Astro, MYSQL would be my primary stack. I would be glad to learn a something new when there's a call for it. But before you go, I would like to say

"Build it, Don't Tell"
"Learn It, Use It, Know It"
"Don't Absorb Knowledge, Utilize It"
"It's okay to be lost, but never lost hope in the dots connecting in the future"
