# Ming that

Have you wondered how image width and height remain consistent on ecommerce websites? Well, I did wonder how and came up with two conclusions (there could be more lol)

The first been, there are couple of graphic designer or photo editors who prepare those quality images then send them over to a moderator who uploads them, which sounds very feasible in leading ecommerce companies. How about SME's, that doesn't have enough resources for that much workforce, but just a web developer and a moderator. Then came the second conclusion, the web developer could have utilized a library or package to help achieve that.

How would that package have been created, with what possible ?native api ? Those questions springed up MING in my head which could be referred to as:

For M:
_ Manipulated
_ Modified
_ Minimized
_ Maximized
Images.

Ming is really something basic, but I know that building this would help me understand how to utilize the canvas api which I have always been terrified of, and also I would be building a package that others could find useful apart from myself.

Would you use ming ?
